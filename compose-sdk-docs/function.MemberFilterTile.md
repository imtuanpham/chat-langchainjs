# React Component MemberFilterTile

UI component that allows the user to select members to include/exclude in a
filter. A query is executed against the provided data source to fetch
all members that are selectable.

## Example

Below is an example for filtering countries in the `Country` dimension of the `Sample ECommerce` data model.
```tsx
const [countryFilter, setCountryFilter] = useState<Filter | null>(null);

return (
<MemberFilterTile
  title={'Country'}
  attribute={DM.Country.Country}
  filter={countryFilter}
  onChange={setCountryFilter}
/>
);
```
